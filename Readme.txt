This is a resubmission. I took the input from my previous grader and made some changes to my code.

This challenge looks at various ticker symbols with a view to determine the quarterly performance of each ticker symbol.

 
We are also to reveal the ticker symbol with the highest percentage change, lowest percentage change and greatest total volume.


I used VBA script to achieve this, with additional functionality to run the macro across multiple worksheets.


I have attached 4 screenshots showing the results of running my macro across all 4 worksheets (each worksheet represents a quarter).


I have also attached my vba scripts/txt files (one recursive and another non-recursive).


I used vba script to populate two new columns, first labeled as 'open' (represents open value /ticker symbol /quarter) and second labeled as 'close' (represents close value /ticker symbol/ quarter). I did this to allow for a step by step calculation of 'quarterly change' and 'percent change'. 
Breaking down the steps also allows me to identify and fix any coding errors more quickly.
